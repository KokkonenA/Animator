Interim report 1 - 12.3.2021

I have implemented some of the logic: namely classes Speechbubble, Pos, Joint, Head, Figure and Expression. They
are not fully ready though. I also have implemented partially the class Frame. In the class animator some of
the graphic user interface is implemented. I drew the basic outline and created the menu buttons, though currently
all they do is print a small message to console.

Currently there is some build error.


Interim report 2 - 29.3.2021

Progress has been a bit slower this time. I had issues with building my project that only got resolved after I
uninstalled and reinstalled the IDE. So that took some time to figure out. After that I implemented method
addFrame for object Animator that adds new frame next to the current one. Regarding that I made methods for several
other classes (cloneFrame, cloneFigure, cloneJoint etc.). The purpose of those methods is to make the new frame
a copy of the previous one. I also made a text file with an idea what the format of the structure should look like.
Some other small changes too, next I start to tackle the GUI a bit more. I have also forgotten about testing completely.
Maybe I should focus on that more.

Workload has been roughly 10 hours. I am behind schedule at this point. But luckily I have two weeks ahead without
much school work from other courses so I try to catch up.


Interim report 3 12.4.2021

During this time I've mainly focused on getting the stick figure in to the frame so that the joints can be moved.
I realised that using Canvas was not working as the Viewer so I changed it to a simple Pane so I can add scalafx
Shapes. I changed the classes Joint, SpeechBubble and Head so they inherit from scalafx.scene.shape. With that I can
add the objects straight to Viewer.children. I also created class Arm that represent the lines between the joints. Now
you can add figures and move the arms by clicking and dragging the joints.
The rotation doesnt yet work as its supposed to but it's getting there.

I wrote the components of the main GridPane in their own separate files. Really the only reason is that the code of the
file Animator.scala is easier to read.

I estimate my workload has been roughly 15 to 20 hours. I am still a bit behind and I fear I'll be in hurry soon.
There is also some bigger changes I'd like to do so that implementing new features would be simpler but I fear
it would take too long time so I just keep going forward and if I have time in the end I'll polish the code.
