Interim report 1 - 12.3.2021

I have implemented some of the logic: namely classes Speechbubble, Pos, Joint, Head, Figure and Expression. They
are not fully ready though. I also have implemented partially the class Frame. In the class animator some of
the graphic user interface is implemented. I drew the basic outline and created the menu buttons, though currently
all they do is print a small message to console.

Currently there is some build error.


Interim report 2 - 29.3.2021

Progress has been a bit slower this time. I had issues with building my project that only got resolved after I
uninstalled and reinstalled the IDE. So that took some time to figure out. After that I implemented method
addFrame for object Animator that adds new frame next to the current one. Regarding that I made methods for several
other classes (cloneFrame, cloneFigure, cloneJoint etc.). The purpose of those methods is to make the new frame
a copy of the previous one. I also made a text file with an idea what the format of the structure should look like.
Some other small changes too, next I start to tackle the GUI a bit more. I have also forgotten about testing completely.
Maybe I should focus on that more.
